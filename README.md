Freon: Freeze On Neck personal cooler !

At the heart of Freon is a Peltier element, a cutting-edge thermoelectric device that actively transfers heat away from your skin. This isn't just a fan blowing air around ; it's active cooling that genuinely drops the temperature.

This project is fully open/source open/hardware.
